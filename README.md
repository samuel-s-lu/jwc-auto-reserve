# jwc-auto-reserve

Python script that automatically reserves slots for activities in JWC (e.g. rock climbing, badminton).

To automate the process of "signing-in" without command line input:
    create a Python file "userInfo.py" and create a dictonary in the form
    credentials = {"username": userString, "password": passString}
